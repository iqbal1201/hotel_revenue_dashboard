# Hotel Revenue Project 
This project aims to visualize data story about hotel revenue and other attibutes through Power BI. Some fascinating questions answered in this project are:
1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year? - The hotel has two types of hotel so that it's important to visualize the growing revenue by its category.
2. Should the parking space increased? - The stakeholders want to know whether the guests have tendency bring their own car
3. What trend can we see from the data? - Showing the seasonality of the data.

This project used the datasets of hotel revenue from 2018-2020 (accessed from https://absentdata.com/data-analysis/where-to-find-data/). All the datasets in excel format were genereted in database. Using SQL query (PostgreSQL), all important information were extracted and visualize in dashboard (Power BI).



The step for this project:
1. Importing data from excel to PostgreSQL using DBeaver
2. Selecting important insight using SQL query
3. Connecting PostgreSQL to Power BI
4. Designing and Visualizing information in Power BI
